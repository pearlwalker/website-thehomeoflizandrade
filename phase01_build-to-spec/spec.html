                    <h3>What was thought to be an abandoned nuclear shelter turns out to be the family home of
                        the ANDRADE family.</h3>
                </span>
                <span id="text">
                    <p>
                        Mr. & Mrs. Andrade (names and ages unknown)
                        moved to the property, where they then had a litter
                        of two (Rui Andrade, male, 8; Marielle Andrade,
                        female, 8 years old). The couple raised their litter through
                        young adulthood while on the property, when the daughter
                        seems to have moved out. Rui remained
                        on the property after the death of the
                        original homeowners as the bunker’s sole occupant.
                    </p>
                    <p>Before moving back onto the property,
                        Marielle Andrade allegedly attempted to bring criminal
                        charges against her ex-partner before the case was dropped.
                        The alleged charges include: Domestic and Economic Abuse,
                        Assault and Battery, Improper Disclosure of Medical Records,
                        Medical Fraud Conspiracy, and Wrongful Death of a Newborn.
                        Prosecution was not able to prove intent or liability
                        on the part of the defendant, leading to the court
                        dropping the case.</p>

                    <p>Marielle Andrade moved back to the bunker
                        this summer. Shortly after, she adopted an abandoned
                        kitten (Liz Andrade, female, less than 1yrs), bringing the
                        property’s total occupants to 3 cats. Local
                        pediatrician Marcos Oliviera (male, 6yrs),
                        the cat who informed local government of the
                        property’s status, seemed concerned about the
                        health and wellbeing of the child.
