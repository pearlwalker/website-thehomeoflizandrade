                <h2 id="a01_subheading">What was thought to be an abandoned nuclear shelter turns out to be the
                    family home of
                    the ANDRADE family.</h2>
                <p id="a01_p1">
                    Mr. & Mrs. Andrade (names and ages unknown)
                    moved to the property, where they then had a litter
                    of two (Rui Andrade, male, 8; Marielle Andrade,
                    female, 8 years old). The couple raised their litter through
                    young adulthood while on the property, when the daughter
                    seems to have moved out. Rui remained
                    on the property after the death of the
                    original homeowners as the bunker’s sole occupant.
                </p>
                <p id="a01_p2">
                    Before moving back onto the property,
                    Marielle Andrade allegedly attempted to bring criminal
                    charges against her ex-partner before the case was dropped.
                    The alleged charges include: Domestic and Economic Abuse,
                    Assault and Battery, Improper Disclosure of Medical Records,
                    Medical Fraud Conspiracy, and Wrongful Death of a Newborn.
                    Prosecution was not able to prove intent or liability
                    on the part of the defendant, leading to the court
                    dropping the case.
                </p>
                <p id="a01_p3">
                    Marielle Andrade moved back to the bunker
                    this summer. Shortly after, she adopted an abandoned
                    kitten (Liz Andrade, female, less than 1yrs), bringing the
                    property’s total occupants to 3 cats. Local
                    pediatrician Marcos Oliviera (male, 6yrs),
                    the cat who informed local government of the
                    property’s status, seemed concerned about the
                    health and wellbeing of the child.
